            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                <h4>Dough:</h4>
                <li>1 1/2 c. (340 g.) whole milk</li>
                <li>1/4 c. (50 g.) granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 (1/4-oz.) packet or 2 1/4 tsp. active dry yeast</li>
                <li>3 large eggs, beaten to blend</li>
                <li>4 Tbsp. (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
                <li>6 3/4 c. (810 g.) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
                <li>Neutral oil, for greasing</li>

                <h4>Chicken</h4>
                <li>1 Tbsp. confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp. honey</li>
                <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
                <li>3/4 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>3/4 c. (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, divided</li>
                <li>Flaky sea salt (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <h4>Dough:</h4>
            <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat milk until warm to the touch, between 100° to 110°. In the large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine warm milk, granulated sugar, and yeast. Let sit until yeast is dissolved and foamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, butter, and kosher salt and beat on low speed until just combined. Add flour and continue to beat on low speed until dough comes together, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <h4>Chicken:</h4>
            <li>In a shallow bowl, combine panko, garlic powder, and 1 cup Parmesan. Into another shallow bowl, pour flour. In a third shallow bowl, beat eggs with 1 tablespoon water.</li>
            <li>Pat chicken dry; season with salt and pepper. Dip into flour, shaking off excess, then into egg, then into panko mixture, gently pressing to adhere.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix mozzarella and remaining 1 cup Parmesan. </li>
            <li>Heat broiler. In a large, heavy pot over medium heat, heat oil until a deep-fry or instant-read thermometer registers 350°; if it smokes a bit, that's okay. Set a wire rack in a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Working one at a time, fry chicken until one side is golden brown, about 1 minute. Flip and continue to fry until golden brown on the other side and the sound of the frying chicken gets slightly louder—this is the moisture evaporating from the chicken—about 1 minute more. Transfer to prepared rack. Repeat with remaining chicken. Spoon some marinara over chicken. Sprinkle with cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Broil, watching carefully, until cheese is melted and brown spots form, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide chicken among plates. Top with basil. Serve with remaining marinara alongside.</li>
